> A decentralized, secure messaging application developed as a second-year project for our college project exhibition. This application uses RSA for end-to-end encryption and a simplified blockchain ledger to store message history, ensuring that communication is both private and immutable.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Disclaimer
This project is a proof-of-concept and a learning exercise. It is **NOT SECURE** for real-world use. It contains several known security vulnerabilities.

**Please do not use this application for any sensitive or private communication.**

## ‚ú® Features

* üîí **End-to-End Encryption:** All messages are encrypted using a 2048-bit RSA public/private key pair.
* ‚õìÔ∏è **Blockchain Ledger:** Messages are stored as transactions in a file-based blockchain, creating an immutable chat history.
* üíª **Multi-Client Support:** The server uses threading to handle connections from multiple clients simultaneously.
* üîë **Automatic Key Generation:** The client application automatically generates RSA key pairs for new users.

## üöß Known Issues & Future Improvements

As a prototype, this project has several areas for improvement. The following are key issues that would need to be addressed for a production-ready system:

### Security Vulnerabilities
* **Lack of Authentication:** The server currently trusts the public key sent by the client. A malicious user could impersonate another user by sending their public key.
* **No Message Signing:** The sender of a message is not verified, making it possible for messages to be spoofed.
* **Vulnerability to Replay Attacks:** Captured network traffic could be re-sent to the server to duplicate messages on the blockchain.

### Performance & Usability
* **Inefficient Message Retrieval:** The server scans the entire blockchain file for every request, which is not scalable.
* **Manual Key Exchange:** Users must manually share their public key files to communicate.
* **Hardcoded Server IP:** The server's IP address is hardcoded in the client script.

## üîÆ Future Plans: Decentralized Governance

To enhance the decentralization of the network, we plan to implement a **voting system for new member registration**.

The proposed system would work as follows:
1.  A new user submits a request to join the network.
2.  This request is broadcast to all existing members as a proposal.
3.  Existing members can vote 'yes' or 'no' on adding the new user.
4.  If the proposal receives a majority of 'yes' votes, the new user's public key is officially added to the member list, granting them access to the network.

This would move the system away from a centralized server that accepts anyone, towards a community-governed network.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Cryptography:** `rsa` library
* **Networking:** `socket` module for TCP communication
* **Concurrency:** `threading` module
* **File Integrity:** `filelock` for preventing race conditions

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system follows a simple client-server model where the server's primary role is to maintain the blockchain and relay messages.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 or higher
* pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Run

1.  **Start the Server:**
    Open a terminal and run the server script. It will start listening for connections.
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```

2.  **Run the Client(s):**
    Open one or more new terminal windows and run the client script. Each instance will act as a separate user.
    ```bash
    python client.py
    ```
    Follow the on-screen prompts to register a username, send messages, and retrieve your message history.
